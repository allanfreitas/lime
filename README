#LiME - Less is More Engine#

By Matt Bearman

LiME is a fast and simple online publishing platform, which can be used for blogs as well as normal web pages. LiME doesn't use a database to store and manage entries,
instead text files in markdown format are used. The entire website is complied into raw HTML files when ever you add or update an entry, meaning page loads are very fast.

I built the LiME webpage complier in PHP for no other reason than it's the language I know best. In my mind LiME is more of an idea than a pice of software, and I'd love nothing more than to see
it ported to other languages.

##Installing##
LiME was designed with convention over configuration in mind, so installing is as simple as cloning this Git repository, and pointing your server to the httpdocs/ directory.

**Note:** The httpdocs/ directory will need to be writable by the server.
