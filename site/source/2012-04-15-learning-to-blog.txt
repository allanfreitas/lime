I, Matt Bearman Esq., am not a great writer.

I don't enjoy writing, I never have, but maybe that's just because I suck. I want to enjoy writing, and I want to be better at it, so I'm setting my self the following challenge: Write at least one blog post each week. There's no restrictions on subject or length, although they should at least be longer than a tweet.

I figure writing is a skill like any other, so with practise and effort I should improve. That's the theory anyway.

The question is: does this little intro post count as my entry for this week?... No, that would be too easy. So I now have until Sunday 22nd April to make at least one new entry. 

That's it from me for now, time to make a cup of tea and get back to work. 

I love tea.
