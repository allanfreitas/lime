#Welcome to the LiME Demo Site#

This is the main home page, it is rendered using the template /site/templates/_default.php, if there was a template called index.php, this would be used instead, as the _default template is a fallback for when a page specific template does not exist.

You can see this in action on the [About](/about) page, as it uses the name-matched template /site/templates/about.php.
